           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> This is a total back-builder: upper back, lower back, lats, traps, spinal erectors—the whole deal. And the science backs it up. It's a staple of the best back workouts for men, but make no mistake, it's great for back workouts for women, as well. <br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;"> In your workout:</b>  Do heavy bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout in lower rep ranges, such as 6-8 or 8-10, in order to save your lower back. If you're wrecked from deadlifts, skip it or do it on a second back day later in the week.

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Your first impulse may be to reach for the wide-grip bar, but back-focused EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip. This grip also allows for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle. <br><br><br>

           <b style="color: red;">  In your workout:</b> When used as a mass-building exercise, it's best placed toward the middle or end of your workout for sets of 8-12 reps. It's great as a pump-focused finishing move, as well. <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Unlike every free-weight variation here, the classic seated row maintains constant tension throughout every inch of the movement.
Plus, many gyms have a wide range of handles that you can clip onto a seated cable row with a carabiner, giving you all manner of wide and narrow grips and different hand positions.
            
             <br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red;">In your workout:</b>  Like machines, cables can be loaded up pretty heavily without overly taxing you. These are best done toward the end of your workout, so don't be afraid to go slightly higher-rep here, like 10-12 or even 12-15 reps. <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Unlike T-bar rows or bent-over rows, this increasingly popular movement doesn't torch the lower back—and that's its appeal. It allows you to go as heavy as you want on a row variation, without risk of that "oops, I tweaked something" moment. <br><br><br>
            
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b> This isn't an exercise meant to go heavy or early in a back workout, except perhaps as a warm-up for other rows. Think 8 reps at minimum, and more likely 12-15. <br><br><br><br><br>
