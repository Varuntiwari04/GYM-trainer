           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> This movement seems a lot like the standing barbell curl at first glance. After all, they're both bilateral movements in which you take a shoulder-width, underhand grip on the bar. What makes it different is that, like all of the best muscle-building cable exercises, the angle of loading gives you constant tension on the muscle through the full range of motion. <br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;"> In your workout:</b> Because it's fairly similar to the barbell curl, pick one or the other. If you're doing it first in your workout, go fairly heavy and use a challenging weight for 6-10 reps per set. If you choose to do it later in the workout, go for 8-12 or more per set.

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day. <br><br><br>

           <b style="color: red;">  In your workout:</b>  Hammer curls are usually done in the middle or at the end of a workout in a classic rep range of 8-12 reps. Experiment with isometric holds to create a deep burn that even the pros fear. <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> There are many versions of the preacher curl, and every serious physique builder has their fave. Whatever version you do, you'll get a serious pump, particularly if you have a quality pre-workout or pump supplement coursing through your bloodstream at the time. In fact, this old-school peak-builder can be nearly enough for an entire biceps workout, perhaps with something like hammer curls added to it. <br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red;">In your workout:</b>  Since your arms are against a bench, it's a very strict movement that doesn't allow a lot of cheating. Hence, this movement is best done toward the latter half of your workout for at least 8-12 reps per set. <br><br><br><br><br>

        </figure>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> In contrast to traditional barbell curls where you keep your elbows pinned at your sides, you'll actually push them backward, keeping the bar close to your torso as you bring it up. This reduces the range of motion, so don't expect to take it up very high. <br><br><br>
            
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b>  You can program this just like any other barbell curl, heavy in the beginning or lighter in the middle to end of your workout. Want to make it extra tough? Extend the negative portion of the rep to 3-5 seconds per rep. Repeat for 5-8 reps, perhaps having a spotter help you with the concentric (lifting) portion as needed. <br><br><br><br><br>
