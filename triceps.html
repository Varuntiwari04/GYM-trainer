           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Dips are a proven mass-builder on their own. Their only problem: Lots of people can't do enough reps to get within the ideal muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps. Either that, or they can do way too many. In the former case, use the assisted dip/pull-up machine or a band. In the latter, add weight with a dip belt or a light dumbbell between your knees or feet. <br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;"> In your workout:</b> You can start your triceps workout with dips if they're tough for you. Otherwise, use them in the middle of your workout to pump those arms full of blood. Shoot for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Like dumbbell overhead work, cable overhead presses focus on the often underdeveloped long head. The constant tension provided by the cable might actually make this a better choice than dumbbells if you're picking between the two. <br><br><br>

           <b style="color: red;">  In your workout:</b> This is a great second or third exercise in place of push-downs if you do 3 sets of 8-12 reps. <br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b>  Once your arms go overhead, the long head of the triceps gets prioritized. This head is difficult to target otherwise, which is why it's always a good idea to include some kind of overhead exercise in your triceps workout. <br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red;">In your workout:</b>  Do your extensions toward the second half of your workout, after heavier movements, for around 3 sets of 8-10 reps. Concentrate on getting a good stretch during the eccentric portion of the lift as you lower the weight. <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> For many lifters, this is the quintessential triceps burnout move, and for good reason. It effectively targets the lateral head, is easy to perform—just don't let your arms drift from your sides!—and lends itself easily to dropsets. <br><br><br>
            
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b>  Since this is a single-joint or "isolation" exercise, do it toward the end of your workout for 3 sets of 10-12 reps or slightly higher. <br><br><br><br><br>
