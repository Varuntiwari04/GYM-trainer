           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> A knock against machine-based leg exercises is that the hormone boost they generate just doesn't compare to free weights. But that's not a reason not to do them! It just means do them later in your leg workout when you're already fatigued. It's also easier to use advanced intensity techniques like forced reps and dropsets, because you can change weight quickly and aren't balancing a barbell.<br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;"> In your workout:</b> Hack squats are typically done after free-weight exercises and before single-joint leg movements. The sweet spot is somewhere around 3 sets of 8-12 reps, although if you're following a program built by a hack devotee like Kris Gethin in his 8-Week Hardcore training plan, you can expect that to go up to 20-30 reps and beyond. Consider yourself warned!

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Leg press vs. squat is a classic weight-room debate, but one that misses the point. Strength coach and physical therapist John Rusin explains why in his article, "Don't Do High-Rep Squats, Deads, and Bench! Do These Instead." Squats are for doing early in a leg workout and going heavy, he explains, and leg presses are for doing afterward for high reps. Sounds like a recipe for leg growth to us! <br><br><br>

           <b style="color: red;">  In your workout:</b>  You can't go wrong with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Occasionally, when the pre-workout is flowing, do a few epic sets of 20-30 reps or more. This exercise also goes exceptionally well with intensity-boosting techniques such as rest-pause, dropsets, or forced reps. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> What makes this single-joint machine move worthy of being listed among squats and deadlifts? Because too many lifters think those two exercises are "enough" for their hamstrings. They're definitely not!

            In his article, "A Scientific Approach to Hamstring Training," muscle-building expert Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D., conclusively makes the case that for balanced, strong hamstrings you need curls, too. Specifically, the lower hamstrings are activated dramatically more during seated leg curls than deadliftsâ€”even stiff-legged deadlifts. <br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red;">In your workout:</b> Keep it simple: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, coming close to muscle failure. This is a low-risk, high-reward move, so occasionally add in some slow negatives or dropsets to make it more intense. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Shifting the bar from the back to the front of the body changes your squat dramatically. Front squats emphasize the quads over the glutes and hams, which means you'll sacrifice some of the load. It also helps you maintain a more vertical torso position, which can help increase squat depth and perhaps decrease the risk of lower back injury. <br><br><br>
            
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b>  These are brutally hard, so do them first, when your energy levels are highest, for 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps. Favor the lower end if you're looking to build strength. <br><br><br><br><br>
