           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b>  Not only is the incline bench press a classic way to build the upper chest, many lifters find them to be a more comfortable "main lift" for the shoulders than flat benching. It's great with a barbell or multi-grip bar, but maybe be even better with dumbbells, since you can customize your grip to increase focus on the upper pecs. <br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;">Pro tip:</b> Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which EMG results have shown works the front delts as much as the chest. If possible, go for a lower incline, such as 30 degrees, to focus squarely on the upper pecs. <br><br> <br><br><br>

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but machine press and cable press variations have some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets. <br><br>

Feel like a step down from free weights? It shouldn't. EMG research demonstrates that the machine bench press recruits the shoulders far less than free-weight variations. This allows you to really target your pecs. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka, pec-deck) is a more effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. If your gym has one, it's a great move to get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b> As a pre-exhaust, hit a few sets of 10-15 before your presses.As a burnout, hit the machine fly last in your routine for sets of around 10-12. Experiment with dropsets, partial reps, and other intensity boosters. Don't be afraid to take this movement to failure, and know that you've earned your post-workout protein shake. <br><br><br><br>
