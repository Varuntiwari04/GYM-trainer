           <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Swapping out the barbell for dumbbells on overhead presses works each side independently, which is great for balanced development. The range of motion is also a bit longer, which can help maximize muscle growth. Pressing in a seated position also removes the lower body, allowing you to focus squarely on the shoulders. <br> <br><br>

<b style="color: red;"> In your workout:</b> Do it first in your workout for solid, heavy sets of 6-8 reps. Going heavy? Have a spotter help you get the weights into the starting position and give you a spot (or even a forced rep or two) as you push toward failure.

        <p>
           <b style="color: red;"> Why it's on the list:</b> Like the push-press, this is a challenging full-body lift. It was once contested as a powerlift, and with a barbell, remains a popular lift for setting ambitious strength goals. But research has shown that dumbbells elicit a greater degree of muscle activation, even if you can't lift quite as much total weight. <br><br><br>

           <b style="color: red;">  In your workout:</b> After a thorough warm-up, choose a challenging weight, but not one so heavy that you break form. Classic rep schemes like 5x5 for muscle and strength are great. For more pure size gains, go for sets of 6-8 or 8-10 where the last one is a struggle, but you're in no danger of failing the rep. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> The "why" of this move is simple enough: raising your straight arm directly in front of you activates the anterior head of your deltoids. But it's not a must-do for everyone! Presses hammer the anterior delts, and these muscles already tend to be disproportionately large among individuals who overdo chest training compared to back training. <br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red;">In your workout:</b>  If you're going to do it, do it in the second half of your shoulder workout. It's a great last movement for a burnout, especially superset with lateral raises, as in Abel Albonetti's Brutal Mass-Building Shoulder Workout. <br><br><br><br><br>

        </figure>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Why it's on the list:</b> Upright rows have a reputation as a shoulder destroyer, but like anything, it's all about how you perform them. As personal trainer Jimmy Pe√±a explains in the article, "How Wide Should My Grip Be on an Upright Row," don't take a close grip, which can internally rotate your shoulders. Instead, take a wider grip where your upper arms go directly out to your sides. <br><br><br>
            
            <b style="color: red;"> In your workout: </b> Even though it's technically a multijoint movement, don't do this exercise first in your workout. Do it after your presses for 8-10 reps per set, in supersets with front raises, or as a burnout move at the end of your routine. <br><br><br><br><br>
